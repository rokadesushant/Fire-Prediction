  <p class="lead">Forests make beautiful landscapes. Forests have a great variety of vegetation. Trees and plants of all kinds make up a forest. Animals and birds that live on trees can be sighted in forests. Large mammals like elephants, tigers, leopards and rhinoceroses, as also smaller ones like bears, hyenas and jackals live in forests. Mammals may be either herbivorous or carnivorous creatures. Many colorful birds that include resident birds as also migratory birds fly about in forests. Insects, reptiles and amphibians too live in forests. A variety of snakes as also insects like butterflies and bees also live in forests. Forests also have water bodies so that aquatic creatures also can be found in forests. The water bodies are also sources of drinking water for the many wildlife species that inhabit forests. Forests are, therefore, habitats to a large variety of fauna. Forests are visited for their natural beauty by tourists.
